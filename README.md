# better-brave

My recommendations for the ultimate configuration of the Brave Browser :)

**NOTE:** This is specifically tailored for Brave on Desktop. For Android, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave-android), and for iOS, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave-ios).

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/better-brave).

# Additional recommendations

* Keep extensions to a minimum and only install what you actually need. Having unnecessary extensions reduces performance, increases attack surface, increases fingerprintability, etc.

* Similarly, [please don't use more than one content blocking extension](https://x.com/gorhill/status/1033706103782170625). Don't install any content blocking extensions if you use Brave's built-in Shields as well.

* Use a (reputable) VPN. I would recommend either [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).

* Use a (reputable) anti-virus if possible. On Windows, you can use the built-in [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender_Antivirus), on macOS, you can stick to the built-in [XProtect](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web), and on Linux, you can use [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/).
